            <p> My name is Mai Dang. I am a Data Science student at Southern Methodist University. I am currently working as a Data Analyst at a healthcare company in Dallas, Texas. I have a Bachelor of Science in Mamethmatics from the Briar CLiff Univeristy in Sioux City, Iowa. I have been working in the education field for almost 10 years. I have worked as a Lead Educator, a Business Analyst, and a Data Specialist. I am interested in learning more about Data Science and Machine Learning. I am currently working on a project to predict the housing price in Ames, Iowa. I am also working on a project to predict the hours and budget for an interior design company. I am looking forward to learning more about Data Science and Machine Learning in the SMU Data Science program.
